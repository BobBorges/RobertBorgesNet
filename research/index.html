                            <h1>Research</h1>
                            <p>The prominent theme covered in my research is language change, especially the relationship between change on the one hand, and social identity and multilingual language practice on the other. My research has progressed from a strictly diachronic perspective to include aspects of synchronic variationist linguistics, and more recently second language acquisition and psycholinguistic perspectives on multilingualism. Nevertheless, the underlying questions in my research remain diachronically oriented. Throughout my studies and career as a linguist, I have been engaged with inter- and multidisciplinary approaches to the study of language, relying on data-driven and usage-based accounts of language as a basis for both research and teaching. </p>
                            <h2 id="currentResearch" class="hlynk">Current Research</h2>                          
                            <p>My current research project <em>New Speakers of Wymysorys: the reconstitution of the local language and sociolinguistic identity in Wilamowice</em> operates under the main hypothesis that "new speakers" provide an ideal context to observe the instantiation of linguistic innovation and the spread of these innovations within a speech community <em>in situ</em>. In brief, a <em>new speaker</em> here refers to an individual who has learned a language with little or no exposure in the home via educational programs outside the home after a community-level shift (<a title="O’Rourke, Bernadette, Joan Pujolar, and Fernando Ramallo (2015). “New Speakers of Minority Languages: The Challenging Opportunity. Foreword”. In: <em>International Journal of the Sociology of Language</em> 2015.231, pp. 1–20. issn: 1613-3668. doi: 10.1515/ijsl-2014-0029.">Orourke, Pujolar, and Ramallo 2015</a>:1). Situated in already volatile speech communities thanks to language shift, new speakers tend to play an active role in the community and represent larger and more influential proportion of the overall speech community than learners of non-threatened languages. Such contexts are conducive to the observation of the development interlanguage features that spread through dense networks of minority language users and ascend to the status of or model for other language learners, replacing the ``native'' variety as target.</p>
                            <p>As a critically endangered language, Wymysorys serves as an ideal case in the study of new speakers. Wymysorys is a West Germanic langauge, spoken in the southern part of Poland, at the boarder of the Silesian and Lesser Poland Voivodships. The language became threatened due to severe oppression by communist authorities after WWII; speakers were required to hide their affiliation with the language for survival. Today there are approximately fifty speakers of the language; about half of them are elderly (>80) "native speakers" and the rest are teenagers and twenty-something new speakers, who learned the language through grassroots revitalization efforts that began ca. ten years ago, led almost exclusively by children.</p>
                            <p>In order to <em>observe change</em>, a relatively data-heavy approach is necessary, thus a longitudinal design has been implemented whereby a similar set of tasks are used to collect data from the same individuals at different points in time. The data collection procedures rely on best practices set out in Language Documentation and draw on methods developed in sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics. In a nutshell, participants:</p>
                                <ul class="inMainList">
                                    <li>answer a set of closed questions (questionnaire)</li>
                                    <li>narrate a short series of video clips</li>
                                    <li>complete a rapid automated picture naming (RAN) test in Wymysorys and Polish</li>
                                    <li>answer a set of open-ended questions (interview)</li>
                                    <li>complete a series of director-matcher tasks (in pairs)</li>
                                </ul>
                            <p>These procedures result in a rich set of data for each speaker at a given time, including spoken language data, experimental data, and information about the speaker's background, language attitudes, experiences as a new speaker, language practices, and social networks.</p>
                            <p>Data are then subject to a mixed methods analysis to elucidate individual and group trajectories. Questionnaires result in a set of numerical answers, which are used as a basis for constructing speaker profiles, and are stored for further quantitative analysis as variables in conjunction with language data. Spoken language data (narration and director-matcher task) are transcribed in functional orthography and analyzed in terms of morphosyntactic feature variation. Proficiency measures are also derived directly from the spoken language data, including words per minute, "um" rate, and lexical density. The experimental data derived from the RAN test is analyzed in terms of naming latencies in order to derive a measure of entrenchment  for Wymysorys and Polish in each speaker. Interview data are analyzed in terms of Interpretational Phenomenological Analysis (<a title="Smith, Jonathan A. (1996). “Beyond the Divide between Cognition and Discourse: Using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis in Health Psychology”. In: <em>Psychology & Health</em> 11.2, pp. 261–271. issn: 0887-0446, 1476-8321. doi: 10.1080/ 08870449608400256.">Smith 1996</a>) in order to better understand how speakers construct their own experiences within the prevalent societal ideologies. Finally, with these ``snap shots'' of each speaker individual trajectories of acquisition, group development, and the spread of linguistic innovation can be constructed.</p>
                            <p>Although the project is still ongoing, preliminary results are encouraging. The RAN test seems to provide a promising avenue for evaluating language entrenchment (proficiency), though further testing is certainly warranted (see the attached manuscript, currently under review). In light of a tentative proficiency rank order among speakers, grammatical gender and case has been explored in a variationist perspective; these analyses show, on the one hand, that feature variants are subject to the constraints expected from the acquisition process (if compared to related languages like Dutch and German) but on the other hand, there is some evidence of ideolectal restructuring of the gender / case system among some new speakers (presented at the Polish Academy of Science, October 2, 2018). Whether these varieties go on to serve as model or target for other learners remains to be seen (pending analysis of T2 data collected in September / October 2018).</p>

                            <p>Under the auspices of the project <a title="CUTLURECONTACT 312795, Starting Grant, European Research Council, 2012-2017; Principal Investigator: Justyna Olko" href="http://www.encounters.al.uw.edu.pl/eng/about-the-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Europe and America in Contact: a Multidisciplinary Study of Cross-cultural  Transfer in the New World Across Time</em></a>, my colleagues and I investigated the long-term evolution of Nahuatl grammatical structure under the influence of Spanish. I formally incorporated theoretical and methodological insights from variationist linguistics into the study design. With this, we investigated distributions of feature variants in individual idiolects over time, controlling for social and geographic variables. One key contribution of this work is that seemingly minor contact-induced changes (from synchronic perspective), such as borrowing a single preposition, can spawn complete systemic realignment, disrupting word order tendencies and unraveling rigid polysynthetic patterns, as in the Nahuatl case. We also noticed that individuals’ proficiency seemed to condition the types of variants preferred, e.g. by language learners, stable-proficiency speakers, or attriters.</p>

                            <h3 id="pastSuriname" class="hlynk">Dynamics of Language Contact in Suriname</h3>
                            <p>This project formed the basis for my doctoral dissertation. Here is the description from the back cover of the dissertation:</p>
                            <blockquote><p>Language lives. And just like other living things, languages come into being, develop over time, and eventually die. Often these developments are motivated by interaction with other languages, known as language contact. This dissertation contains a bundle of articles that report on the various ways that languages effect each other and the factors that condition the linguistic results in the Surinamese context.
                            <p>Following a chapter summarizing socio-historical developments of Suriname from its beginnings as a plantation colony to a modern multiethnic, multilingual country, the reader will find a case study detailing the various formative processes of language mixture, intertwining, and obfuscation that led to the creation of Kumanti, a ritual language spoken among the Ndyuka.</p>
                            <p>The three subsequent chapters contain case studies of contact-induced language change among Suriname’s languages. The first explores convergence in the semantics of kinship terms in a sample of Surinamese languages. A similar language sample is employed in an investigation of contact induced developments among the languages’ tense, mood, and aspect systems. The following chapter argues that the syntactic structures associated with Dutch particle verbs has been transferred to Suriname’s creole languages.</p>
                            <p>The last case study addresses questions of language death and linguistic variation among a small group of Maroons, the Coppename Kwinti.</p>
                            <p>These case studies allow for a number of generalizations to be made about the mechanisms and processes of language contact in Suriname which can hopefully be useful in our further understanding of other complex contact settings and language contact in general.</p></blockquote>
                            <p>Key contributions arising from this work are (a) the multiple moving targets model, which states that the directionality of language contact and the areas of grammar affected by language contact are highly fluid, and heavily conditioned by socio-political –“language external”– factors (Muysken: “Borges’ Law”); (b) a grammar sketch and proposed classification of a ritual / secret language Kumanti; (c) identification of novel, contact-induced features in Surinamese creoles, notably Germanic particle verb constructions, which had never been described in the Surinamese context and are not known to exist in any other creole languages.</p>

                            <p>With the rise of urbanization around the world, many cities have seen the conglomeration of both regional dialects and increased multilingualism. Such settings give rise to a host of socially motivated multilingual and multidialectal language practices, where language choice itself can be seen as a unit of meaning. As such, some cities are hotbeds for diachronic language processes such as dialect leveling and contact-induced language change. I envision a project (or projects) where multilingual and multidialectal practices are investigated from a usage-based point of view. While there is much literature on urban multiligualism that relies on survey data and self reporting, a usage-based approach would necessarily be focused around communities of practices, and include both social network studies as well as variationist and / or diachronic perspective. Such programs are highly feasible and affordable to initiate, especially in cities where the host institution is located. They have enormous potential to grow into larger research groups that are beneficial for local visibility of the host department and foster community involvement / reciprocity and potential social impact through informing local policy maker and educators, while providing accessible, real-world infrastructure for students to gain practical field experience within reasonable reach of their home university.</p>

                            <h3 id="spokenCorpora" class="hlynk">Automating Spoken Language Corpora Development</h3>
                            <p>If you have ever had the "pleasure" of transcribing audio recordings of spoken language, you'll know that it is a time consuming, tedious, and potentially frustrating endeavor. As a linguist with a usage-based theoretical orientation, my work is based on actual observations of empirical, spoken language data. However, the majority of tools and techniques developed in corpus lingiustics that are capable of aiding analyses of relatively large sets of data rely on textual data. The investment required to transcribe audio, largely limits the size of spoken language corpora, meaaning that studies of spoken language tend to rely on relatively small, expensive-to-create corpora. This bottleneck problem problem is potentially solved &mdash; at least for some languages &mdash; with the help of speech recognition. I have recently developed a workflow that utilizes speach recognition technology to "auto-transcribe" spoken data from languages where recognition technology is already available. The workflow combines the power of bash scripting and Python with the utility of ELAN and its XML-based data storage in order to chunk and speech recognize audio, then time-align the output text with the original audio. This "set it and forget it" method allows for the relatively fast creation of textual corpora from spoken langauge data, making these data available to the tools and techniques used in corpus linguistics. Initial tests are promising, and I look forward to further testing the workflow and applying it practically to a research question.</p>

                            <p><blockquote>Endangered minority languages in Europe have seen an upsurge in revitalization activities in recent decades. The most successful of these are organized at the grassroots level and consist of out-of-home language learning programs, which initiate new speakers in an effort to increase the overall speaker population of that language. As typically very active members within an endangered language speech community, those engaged with revitalization activities, who are often new speakers themselves, are in a prime position to influence community wide speech behavior, reestablishing norms set by previous generations of speakers. Because these new speakers are learners themselves and situated within the already volatile linguistic setting due endangerment, they provide an ideal case to study the relationships among language acquisition, language variation, and language change.</blockquote></p>
                            <p><blockquote>Although the persistent hypothesis that second language acquisition plays a role in diachronic language change is well accepted by many scholars, the empirical basis to support such a role is elusive, and illustrations of precise mechanisms and trajectories of language change in relation to acquisition are even more fleeting. The proposed project will address this hypothesis by conducting parallel panel studies among activist new speakers in three endangered European minority languages – Kashubian, South Saami, and Wymysorys. These studies will track the development of new speakers’ proficiencies, language attitudes, and language practices in order to document the interrelated process of language acquisition, instantiation of linguistic innovation, and spread of novel linguistic features. Data collection protocols rely on insights from language documentation, socio-, and psycholinguistics. A mixed methods approach will be taken in the data analysis. The resulting corpora will be open-access archived for further use among linguists, pedagogues, and the speech communities themselves.</blockquote></p>

                            <p>DigiWil is an envisioned project that would create a digital repository for Wilamowice's linguistic and cultural heritage. The idea for the project was developed as an offshoot and/or continuation of my <a href="#currentResearch">current research</a> project and my observation of local efforts to establish a physical museum. In early 2018, I lodged an application with the <em>Vetenskapsrådet</em>, 'The Swedish Research Council', under a special digital humanities call. Unfortunately, the project was not funded under this program, though I think it's an important and interesting project, for which I will continue to seek funding. The application abstract is:</p>
                            <p><blockquote>The aims of this project are to create an archive of, conduct research on, and make available linguistic-cultural heritage collections of Wilamowice, a town in southern Poland, home to a unique culture and a severely endangered language, Wymysorys. The project takes a Digital Humanities approach to gathering / collecting, and processing data, while guided by the principles of Participatory Action Research, especially in terms of researcher-community engagement and collective goal setting. The project will create a digital archive of existing linguistic-cultural heritage collections, which includes a large number of audiovisual recordings, manuscripts, and physical objects relevant to the study and preservation of the local language and cultural heritage, such as antiques and folk costumes. Additional spoken language data will be collected with the remaining elderly native speakers of Wymysorys (n=25), as well as the blossoming group of New Speakers (n=20). Rigorous data management and the application of computational methodologies from natural language processing will provide a robust dataset to empirically address questions related to language structure, variation, and change. The archive and other project results will be made available to the public, stored permanently on the web with a persistent identification number, and a user-friendly tool will be developed for browsing, querying, and accessing individual entries in the archive with minimal technological requirements.</blockquote></p>
                            <p>The project is organized around five core work pakages. Results of each package synergize to answer the main research question &mdash; how is endangerment and revitalization reflected in the evolution of the Wymysorys language &mdash; while preserving providing welcome open access to numerous privately held collections of Wilamowice's linguistic and cultural heritage.
