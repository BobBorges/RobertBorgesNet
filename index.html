                            <h1>Robert Borges (linguist)</h1>
                            <p class="topParagraph">I am a linguist with a background in sociolinguistics, language description, and linguistic typology. My main research interests center around the relationship between social identity, multilingualism, and language change.</p>
                            <p>The prominent theme covered in my research is language change, especially the relationship between change on the one hand, and social identity and multilingual language practice on the other. My research has progressed from a strictly diachronic perspective to include aspects of synchronic variationist linguistics, and more recently second language acquisition and psycholinguistic perspectives on multilingualism. Nevertheless, the underlying questions in my research remain diachronically oriented. Throughout my studies and career as a linguist, I have been engaged with inter- and multidisciplinary approaches to the study of language, relying on data-driven and usage-based accounts of language as a basis for both research and teaching. </p>
                            <h2 id="current" class="hlynk">Recent Research</h2>
                            <p>I am interested in the continued pursuit of two interrelated lines of research, which align with my broad interest in language evolution in multilingual contexts and empirical methodologies: (1) automating spoken-language corpora development, and (2) the study of new speakers of endangered minority languages. Some further detail can be found on the <a href="research/index.html">Research</a> tab.</p>
                            <p>In my current position in the Department of English and American Studies at Friedrich-Schiller University Jena, I am mainly engaged with building infrastructure for a large scale parallel, multilingual corpus of spoken-language data from the European Parliament.</p> 
                            <p>I plan to post further details about this corpus in the near future...</p>

                            <h4>Paper at The Society for Pidgin and Creole Linguistics summer meeting</h4>
                            <p><strong>2019&bull;06&bull;11</strong> I presented a pilot study on language use in the Surinamese Parliament, together with Margot van den Berg (Utrecht University) at the SPCL summer meeting in Lisbon. The title of our talk was <i>Language contact and language choice in parliamentary speech in Suriname</i>. And here is our abstract:</p>
                            <p>In this paper, we will present preliminary results from a pilot study of language use in the Surinamese Parliament “De Nationale Assemblée” (DNA). As Suriname's main legislative body, the DNA meets frequently (multiple times per week) to conduct its business in public meetings. Public DNA meetings are audio video recorded and published on the body's Youtube channel since 2011. To date, the DNA has published over one thousand recordings of their public meetings. Meetings follow a rather rigid set of rules for conduct (DNA 1990), and although there is no mention of language in the Reglement van Orde, Dutch is the default language of communication. The Dutch is of a regional character, and despite the formality of the meetings, members regularly switch to Sranan, the country's lingua franca, during these meetings. Occasionally other Surinamese languages, such as Ndyuka for example, are used.</p>
                            <p>Parliamentary debates contain impactful information and special, formalized and often persuasive and emotional language. They are therefore considered an important resource for many disciplines in digital humanities and social sciences. Corpora have been constructed from parliamentary debates, for example, within the EU (Fiser and Lenardic 2018) and utilized in e.g. in discourse analysis and sociolinguistics (Hirst et al. 2014; Rheault et al. 2016; Bayley 2004). In order to study language use in the DNA, we rely on a newly constructed corpus of spoken language data that has been extracted from recordings of the DNA’s public meetings. Corpus construction has been automatized using an innovative combination of ELAN (Sloetjes & Wittenburg 2008) and its built in recognizers, elan2split (Cavar 2016), Python, and Google's speech recognition API. Our corpus currently consists of approximately 7 hours of recorded DNA meetings. The uncorrected transcripts yeild ca 36,000 words / 5,700 utterances from 29 participants.</p>
                            <p>We will provide a brief overview of the corpus building methodology and discuss preliminary results of our investigation into:</p>
                            <p><ul class="inMainList">
                                <li>feature variation, focusing on auxiliaries, verb-preposition combinations, and the Dutch pronominal <i>er</i>;</li>
                                <li>pragmatic aspects of language use such as persuasion and negotiation;</li>
                                <li>language choice among Surinamese parliamentarians.</li>
                            </ul></p>
                            <p>Our findings show that (a) the influence of Sranan on the Dutch morphosyntactic and discourse structure is pervasive among Parliamentarians' speech, despite the formality of the setting, and that (b) language choice is agentive – the use of Sranan, as non-default language, carries added meaning when used in the DNA context. Thus, our findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of language contact on Surinamese parliamentary language, an understudied language style, and Surinamese society as a whole. They further showcase the utility of parliamentary resources in linguistic research.</p>
