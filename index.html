                            <h1>Robert Borges (linguist)</h1>
                            <p class="topParagraph">I am a linguist with a background in sociolinguistics, language description, and linguistic typology. My main research interests center around the relationship between social identity, multilingualism, and language change.</p>
                            <p>The prominent theme covered in my research is language change, especially the relationship between change on the one hand, and social identity and multilingual language practice on the other. My research has progressed from a strictly diachronic perspective to include aspects of synchronic variationist linguistics, and more recently second language acquisition and psycholinguistic perspectives on multilingualism. Nevertheless, the underlying questions in my research remain diachronically oriented. Throughout my studies and career as a linguist, I have been engaged with inter- and multidisciplinary approaches to the study of language, relying on data-driven and usage-based accounts of language as a basis for both research and teaching. </p>
                            <h2 id="current" class="hlynk">Current Research</h2>
                            <p>I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="http://www.valentin.uu.se" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hugo Valentin Centre</a>, Uppsala University in Sweden (2017&bull;07&ndash;2019&bull;06), where I contribute to the line of research on socio-cultural phenomena and processes of change related to the ethnic dimension in human life. Find me in the Uppsala University employee "<a href="https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N17-1223" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Katalog</a>".</p>
                            <p>My current research project <em>New Speakers of Wymysorys: the reconstitution of the local language and sociolinguistic identity in Wilamowice</em> operates under the main hypothesis that "new speakers" provide an ideal context to observe the instantiation of linguistic innovation and the spread of these innovations within a speech community <em>in situ</em>. In brief, a <em>new speaker</em> here refers to an individual who has learned a language with little or no exposure in the home via educational programs outside the home after a community-level shift (<a title="O’Rourke, Bernadette, Joan Pujolar, and Fernando Ramallo (2015). “New Speakers of Minority Languages: The Challenging Opportunity. Foreword”. In: <em>International Journal of the Sociology of Language</em> 2015.231, pp. 1–20. issn: 1613-3668. doi: 10.1515/ijsl-2014-0029.">Orourke, Pujolar, and Ramallo 2015</a>:1). Situated in already volatile speech communities thanks to language shift, new speakers tend to play an active role in the community and represent larger and more influential proportion of the overall speech community than learners of non-threatened languages. Such contexts are conducive to the observation of the development interlanguage features that spread through dense networks of minority language users and ascend to the status of or model for other language learners, replacing the ``native'' variety as target.</p>
                            <p>As a critically endangered language, Wymysorys serves as an ideal case in the study of new speakers. Wymysorys is a West Germanic langauge, spoken in the southern part of Poland, at the boarder of the Silesian and Lesser Poland Voivodships. The language became threatened due to severe oppression by communist authorities after WWII; speakers were required to hide their affiliation with the language for survival. Today there are approximately fifty speakers of the language; about half of them are elderly (>80) "native speakers" and the rest are teenagers and twenty-something new speakers, who learned the language through grassroots revitalization efforts that began ca. ten years ago, led almost exclusively by children.</p>
                            <p>Although the project is still ongoing, preliminary results are encouraging. The area of grammatical gender and case, for example, has been explored in a variationist perspective; these analyses show, on the one hand, that feature variants are subject to the constraints expected from the acquisition process (if compared to related languages like Dutch and German) but on the other hand, there is some evidence of ideolectal restructuring of the gender / case system among some new speakers (presented at the Polish Academy of Science, October 2, 2018). Whether these varieties go on to serve as model or target for other learners remains to be seen (pending analysis of most recently collected data &mdash; September / October 2018).</p>

                            <h4>Talk &ndash; Automated spoken-language corpus building: code mixing in De Nationale Assembl&eacute;e</h4>
                            <p><strong>2019&bull;01&bull;25</strong> I gave a talk at the Empirical Linguistics Working Group (WoGEL) at Uppsala University's Department of Linguistics and Philology, entitled <i>Automated spoken-language corpus building: code mixing in De Nationale Assembl&eacute;e</i>. Here's the abstract:</p>
                            <p>In search of large-ish data to investigate sociolingiustic questions, we often run into a bottleneck problem: spoken language data that is interesting is often too time consuming to transcribe and annotate. At the same time, there are lots of written-language corpora available, but these often aren't suitable to address questions sociolinguists like to answer. In the talk, I will discuss steps I have taken to eliminate the bottleneck in order to study language choice / code mixing in the Surinamese Parliament &mdash; De Nationale Assembl&eacute;e.</p>
                            <p>As a former colony of the Netherlands, Dutch is the de facto national language of Suriname, but the majority of the population speaks Sranan (an anglo-creole) in many everyday interactions.  Despite the formality of Parliament, parliamentarians are known to code mix regularly, if not frequently. I would like to investigate the contexts and the pragmatic motivations in which this code mixing occurs, but I hate to transcribe data, so I sought to find a way to create a robust empirical dataset for my investigation without transcribing endless hours of "really interesting" legislative discussion.</p>
                            <p>To create this dataset, I used a combination of ELAN and its build-in utterance recognizers, python, and google speech recognition to transcribe recordings of the Nationale Assembl&eacute;e meetings without much human intervention. In the pilot, I prepared about 10 hours of recording in an afternoon, then let the computer "do it's thing" overnight. In the morning, I woke up to a transcribed corpus of ca 36,000 words. In the talk, I will walk you through the process in some detail and discuss some open (for me anyhow) questions about the method. My general question for the group is, indeed, "Is there a paper in the method / process itself?", if so, what journal would you propose as a suitable outlet.</p>
